# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

Credit card fraud is a pervasive problem that affects both consumers and financial institutions.

With the increase in online transactions, the risk of fraud has also increased.

In this project, we aimed to develop a model to detect credit card fraud using machine learning techniques.

## Challenges:

The dataset used in this project consisted of 284,807 transactions, of which 492 were identified as fraudulent.

This represents a fraud rate of 0.172%. The data was highly unbalanced, with a large majority of transactions being non-fraudulent.

## Approach:

To overcome the issue of unbalanced data, we implemented two techniques: oversampling using Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) and Under-sampling using Random Under-Sampling Technique (RUS).

## Tech used in this project: 

Python, Sklearn, Random Forest, XGBoost
